    "# ----------------------------------------\n",
    "#\n",
    "# There is no one perfect way to compute quantiles.  Here we offer\n",
    "# two methods that serve common needs.  Most other packages\n",
    "# surveyed offered at least one or both of these two, making them\n",
    "# \"standard\" in the sense of \"widely-adopted and reproducible\".\n",
    "# They are also easy to explain, easy to compute manually, and have\n",
    "# straight-forward interpretations that aren't surprising.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The default method is known as \"R6\", \"PERCENTILE.EXC\", or \"expected\n",
    "# value of rank order statistics\". The alternative method is known as\n",
    "# \"R7\", \"PERCENTILE.INC\", or \"mode of rank order statistics\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# For sample data where there is a positive probability for values\n",
    "# beyond the range of the data, the R6 exclusive method is a\n",
    "# reasonable choice.  Consider a random sample of nine values from a\n",
    "# population with a uniform distribution from 0.0 to 1.0.  The\n",
    "# distribution of the third ranked sample point is described by\n",
    "# betavariate(alpha=3, beta=7) which has mode=0.250, median=0.286, and\n",
    "# mean=0.300.  Only the latter (which corresponds with R6) gives the\n",
    "# desired cut point with 30% of the population falling below that\n",
    "# value, making it comparable to a result from an inv_cdf() function.\n",
    "# The R6 exclusive method is also idempotent.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For describing population data where the end points are known to\n",
    "# be included in the data, the R7 inclusive method is a reasonable\n",
    "# choice.  Instead of the mean, it uses the mode of the beta\n",
    "# distribution for the interior points.  Per Hyndman & Fan, \"One nice\n",
